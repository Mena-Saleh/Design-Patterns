# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that developers face when writing code. Think of them as templates or "recipes" for solving specific issues so you don’t have to start from scratch every time. They provide tried-and-tested ways to structure your code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale over time.

Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types:

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with flexible ways to create objects, helping you to separate the creation logic from the usage logic. This means that the code responsible for creating an object doesn’t need to know all the details about the object itself.

**Example Patterns:**

- [Singleton](./Creational%20Design%20Patterns/Singleton.md): Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the program.
- [Factory](./Creational%20Design%20Patterns/Factory.md): Provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class.
- [Builder](./Creational%20Design%20Patterns/Builder.md): Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on how objects and classes are composed, helping you create relationships and structures that make your code more organized. They are especially useful when building large, scalable systems with multiple components working together.

**Example Patterns:**

- [Adapter](./Structural%20Design%20Patterns/Adapter.md): Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one class to make it compatible with another.
- [Decorator](./Structural%20Design%20Patterns/Decorator.md): Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without changing its structure.
- [Facade](./Structural%20Design%20Patterns/Facade.md): Provides a simpler interface to a complex system, making it easier to use.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. They help manage complex communication by defining clear interaction protocols.

**Example Patterns:**

- [Observer](./Behavioral%20Design%20Patterns/Observer.md): Defines a one-to-many relationship, where if one object changes, all its dependents are notified.
- [Strategy](./Behavioral%20Design%20Patterns/Strategy.md): Lets you select an algorithm at runtime, where the algorithm varies depending on the situation.
- [Command](./Behavioral%20Design%20Patterns/Command.md): Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.

Each of these patterns provides a specific, proven way to handle situations that many developers encounter. By learning them, you can speed up your development and make your code easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
